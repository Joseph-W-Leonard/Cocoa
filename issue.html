            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Child labor in the cocoa industry is a significant issue, particularly in countries like Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Brazil. Many children are forced to work in hazardous conditions, missing out on education and a safe childhood.</p>

            <h2>Statistics</h2>
            <p>In 2020, there was a 271% increase in child labor in Brazil. This alarming rise highlights the urgent need for effective measures to combat child labor in the cocoa industry.</p>
            <p>According to the latest estimates, 1.56 million children are engaged in child labor on cocoa farms in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. These children often perform hazardous work, including using sharp tools, carrying heavy loads, and handling chemicals.</p>
            <p>In 2018 and 2019, an estimated 2.8 million children from agricultural households in cocoa-producing regions of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire were involved in some form of work, with 1.6 million engaged in child-inappropriate hazardous work.</p>
            <p>Despite efforts to reduce child labor, the prevalence remains high. In a survey conducted in 2018/2019, 60% of children from agricultural households in the survey areas were engaged in illicit child labor practices.</p>

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Several factors contribute to child labor in the cocoa industry, including poverty, lack of access to education, and inadequate enforcement of labor laws. Families often rely on the income generated by their children’s labor to survive.</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>Child labor has severe consequences for the physical and mental health of children. It deprives them of their right to education and exposes them to dangerous working conditions. The long-term effects can include chronic health issues, limited future opportunities, and continued cycles of poverty.</p>

            <h2>Efforts to Combat Child Labor</h2>
            <p>Various international conventions and national laws aim to eliminate child labor. Countries like Brazil have conducted operations to remove children from labor and provide them with education and support. Organizations and companies are also working to implement child labor monitoring and remediation systems.</p>
